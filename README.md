### Data exploration using SQL : [HERE](https://github.com/BovasTheAnalyst/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/a4abc0f194a8d53a7438322ea711a68c3a236706/COVID%20Portfolio%20Project%20-%20Data%20Exploration.sql)
Title: Covid-19 Data Exploration and Analysis

**Overview:**
This data exploration project focuses on analyzing Covid-19 data using various SQL skills such as joins, common table expressions (CTEs), temp tables, window functions, and aggregate functions. The analysis encompasses different aspects, including infection rates, death rates, vaccination progress, and comparisons between countries and continents.

**Key Queries:**
1. **Initial Data Exploration:**
   - Extracts and displays relevant data from the CovidDeaths table, filtering out records where the continent is null.

2. **Total Cases vs Total Deaths:**
   - Calculates and presents the likelihood of death if contracting Covid-19 in countries with 'states' in their name.

3. **Total Cases vs Population:**
   - Illustrates the percentage of population infected with Covid-19 over time.

4. **Countries with Highest Infection Rate:**
   - Identifies countries with the highest infection rates compared to their population.

5. **Countries with Highest Death Count per Population:**
   - Lists countries with the highest death count per population.

6. **Continent Analysis - Death Count per Population:**
   - Breaks down the analysis by continent, showing continents with the highest death count per population.

7. **Global Numbers:**
   - Presents global statistics, including total cases, total deaths, and the overall death percentage.

8. **Population vs Vaccinations:**
   - Examines the percentage of the population that has received at least one Covid vaccine dose over time.

9. **Using CTE for Vaccination Calculation:**
   - Utilizes a common table expression (CTE) to perform calculations on the partitioned data, specifically focusing on rolling people vaccinated.

10. **Using Temp Table for Vaccination Calculation:**
    - Implements a temporary table to store and calculate vaccination percentages based on the population.

11. **Creating a View for Visualization:**
    - Establishes a view named 'PercentPopulationVaccinated' to store relevant data for later visualizations.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Joins, CTEs, temp tables, window functions, and aggregate functions
- Creating views
- Converting data types
- Analyzing and interpreting Covid-19 data
- Developing insights into infection rates, death rates, and vaccination progress

**Conclusion:**
This project showcases a comprehensive analysis of Covid-19 data, providing valuable insights into the impact of the pandemic on different countries and continents. The use of SQL skills demonstrates a proficiency in handling and interpreting large datasets for meaningful conclusions.
